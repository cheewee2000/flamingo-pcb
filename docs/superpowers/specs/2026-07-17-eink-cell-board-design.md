# eink-cell board — design spec (2026-07-17)

Handheld cellular e-ink device board, designed through Flamingo (dogfood #2).
User approved 2026-07-17: overall design, engine slot feature, TP4056 charger,
JST-SH LRA hookup.

## Concept

- **Board:** 66 × 116 mm, 2-layer (jlcpcb-2l), rounded corners (r3), portrait,
  y-up, origin at board center. GND pours both sides.
- **Display:** GDEQ0426FT82 (4.26" 800×480, SSD1677) — glass 105.33 × 62.37 mm,
  adhesive-mounted **centered on the back** (not a placed component). Its
  24 mm FPC tails exit the glass bottom edge, pass through **milled slots**
  below the glass (see FT-variant section for verified geometry), and mate
  flip-lock FPC connectors on the front. Dual-contact connector (XUNPU
  FPC-05FB-24PH20, C2856831) removes the contact-face risk of the fold.
- **All other components on the front.**

## Engine feature: slotted mounting holes

Flamingo outlines are a single closed loop, so internal cutouts are not
expressible; excellon already emits G85 slots for slotted pad drills. Extend
`MountingHole` with optional `slotLength` (total length, > drill) and
`rotation` (deg CCW, slot long axis), plumbed through:
`add_mounting_hole` tool → ops → excellon (G85) → gerber annulus/mask
(stadium) → DRC (hole-to-hole & clearances treat slot as capsule) → zone fill
obstacle → renderer. Tests per layer of plumbing.

## Power

- 1S LiPo → JST-SH (C160388) → **VSYS** → Walter VIN (pin 28; 3.0–5.5 V,
  1.5 A peak — datasheet §3, §5.1).
- USB-C 16P (C165948), CC1/CC2 → 5.1 kΩ to GND. VBUS → TP4056 (C16581),
  PROG ≈ 1.2 kΩ → ~1 A. CHRG (open-drain, active while charging) sinks the
  red **charge LED** from VBUS. Pinout verified from TP4056 datasheet before
  wiring (subagent task).
- Load sharing: BAT+ → SI2301 P-FET (C306861) → VSYS with gate at VBUS
  (100 k pulldown); VBUS → Schottky → VSYS. System runs from USB while
  charging; battery charges undisturbed.
- Walter datasheet §5.1.1: **never power module USB-C and VIN together** —
  silkscreen warning near the module.
- Peripheral rail = Walter **3V3-OUT (pin 26, 250 mA max)**: display
  VCI/VDDIO + boost, DRV2605L. Deep sleep can power-gate all peripherals via
  pin 4 (3V3_EN strap/IO0).

## Walter mounting

Not on LCSC → two 1×14 through-hole 2.54 mm header rows, rows exactly
20.0 mm apart (datasheet Fig 4: 24.8 × 55.0 mm module, castellations at
2.54 mm pitch, 2.40 mm edge inset). Module solders on via headers or directly
on castellations. Antennas are module u.FL (LTE + GNSS) — no carrier RF.
Flashing: module USB-C (with power caveat) or UART0 via header pins 1–4.

## Display drive (GDEQ0426T82 datasheet Rev 1.0, §8.2 reference circuit)

## Peripherals & GPIO map (Walter edge pin → ESP32-S3 IO)

| Function | Walter pin | IO |
|---|---|---|
| EPD SCK / MOSI / CS / DC / RST / BUSY | 8/9/10/11/12/13 | IO38/IO39/IO40/IO41/IO42/IO2 |
| I2C SDA / SCL (DRV2605L) | 23 / 24 | IO8 / IO9 |

## Placement sketch (front, origin center)

- Three tail slots at y=3.5 (bottom-left origin; superseded detail in the
  FT-variant section).
- FPC connectors above slots, entry toward slot.
- EPD boost cluster around connector.
- Walter vertical, left-of-center; header rows 20 mm apart.
- USB-C on the right edge (frontlight tail owns the old bottom-right spot);
  TP4056 + load share + battery JST bottom-left.
- Buttons: (±33, y≈25 & 45) edges. Piezo + DRV2605L + LRA JST top region.
- 4× M2 mounting holes (drill 2.2, pad 4.0), corners inset ~4 mm.
- Silk: version "v0.1", button labels, USB/VIN warning.

## Microphone (added mid-build at user request)

ICS-43434 I2S MEMS mic (C5656610), bottom-port → 0.5 mm NPTH acoustic hole
through the board at the port, placed in the strip above the display glass
(port at y≈111.8 > glass edge 110.7). Datasheet DS-000069: VDD 1.65–3.63 V,
0.1 µF bypass close-in; LR→GND = left mono; 100 kΩ pulldown on SD.
Wiring: WS→IO18 (H1.7), SCK→IO17 (H1.8), SD→IO16 (H1.9).

## Build-time verified facts (agents, 2026-07-17)

- TP4056 (TopPower REV 2.3): 1 TEMP→GND, 2 PROG (1.2 k → 1 A), 3 GND, 4 VCC,
  5 BAT, 6 STDBY, 7 CHRG (open-drain, low while charging), 8 CE→VCC; EP→GND.
- SI2301 & Si1308EDL: pad 1=G, 2=S, 3=D. SS34 & MBR0530WS: pad 1=K, 2=A.
- LEDs: C2286 pad1=A; C72043 pad2=A (they differ).
- Buttons: switch closes pads 1↔2; pads 3/4 are a shorted frame anchor (→GND).
  Note: wiring-verify read the family datasheet as top-actuated; user specified
  this part as side-press and the footprint silk shows an edge tab — kept as
  side-press per user intent, worth a physical check on first articles.
- DRV2605L DGS: 1 REG (1 µF req'd), 2 SCL, 3 SDA, 4 IN/TRIG→GND, 5 EN,
  6 VDD/NC→VDD, 7 OUT+, 8 GND, 9 OUT−, 10 VDD (1 µF + 0.1 µF).
- Display FPC: pin 1 on the LEFT in front view tail-down (GDEQ0426T82-FT01C
  drawing, 2025-12-22). After the fold through the slot, pin 1 lands on the
  board's +x side; J4 (FPC-05FB-24PH20, cable entry over its contact row) is
  rotated 180° to face the slot ⇒ **display pin k ↔ J4 pad 25−k**.
- Boost reference circuit (GDEQ0426T82 §8.2, vector-verified): D_pos SW→PREVGH;
  fly cap SW↔F; D F→GND (cathode GND); D PREVGL→F (anode PREVGL); VGH ties to
  PREVGH (no own cap); VSL has its own 4.7 µF; VGL ties to PREVGL + 4.7 µF.

## FT variant: three tails (frontlight | EPD | touch)

GDEQ0426**FT**82 = FT01C variant. Tails on the bottom edge (front view,
left→right): frontlight 6P | EPD 24P | touch 6P, 0.5 mm pitch, all
bottom-contact, pin 1 left in front view.

**Corrected 2026-07-17 from the FT01C drawing** (vector-measured +
dimension-verified; PDF cached at `boards/eink-cell/datasheets/`):

- All three tails are **24.0 mm** long (glass edge → contact tip). The
  earlier "12.5 mm tail" was a misread — 12.50 is the EPD *contact-section
  width* (24 pins × 0.5 mm).
- Flanking tails: outer stalk edge **10.00 mm from each glass side edge**,
  tail width 3.50 ⇒ contact centerlines 11.75 mm in from the glass edges =
  **±19.44 mm from panel center** (not ±9.6). Board x (glass edges at
  1.815/64.185, front-view-left ↔ board +x): touch **13.57**, frontlight
  **52.44**. Note: the drawing's front-view *sketch* draws the touch tail
  ~1.2 mm further inboard than its own 10.00 dim; dims trusted, slots sized
  generously to absorb this.
- EPD tail: 24.85 from glass left edge to contact-section left edge ⇒
  contact centerline 31.10 from glass left = board x **33.09**. Its
  bending/wide section is ~23.7 mm wide (board x ≈ 22.6–46.35) and passes
  through the slot.
- Touch tail carries a ~10.1 × ~4.8 mm **device area** (FT6336U + steel
  reinforcement) 10.9–20 mm down the tail — it must pass through the slot
  and lands flat on the front over the charger area (low parts only there).
- ⇒ **One merged milled slot** (user preference): 44 × 2 mm, plus a
  copper/via keepout band over it. All components moved out of the three
  tail landing zones on the front.
- **Connector orientation (XUNPU datasheet-verified, cached):** FPC-05FB
  is a REAR-flip connector — cable enters on the EAR-pad side, solder-tail
  row is the back. So J4/J5/J6 are **rot 0** (ears/mouth south toward the
  slot) and the mapping is **display pin k ↔ pad k** (NOT 25−k / 7−k;
  the fold mirror is absorbed by the connector's own pad order). Verified:
  J5's map lands exactly on the FT6336U CTP table; J4's NC pads = display
  NC pins.
- **USB-C**: user placed J1 top-left (17.75, y_top) plug out the top edge;
  C1/R3/R4 satellites nearby below it.
- **2026-07-17 v2: board grew to 66 × 126.5** (all content shifted +10.5 in y)
  to host a GNSS antenna strip below the slot.

- **Touch (J5, FPC-05FB-6PH20 rot 180 at (13.57,20)):** FT6336U — pin k ↔ pad
  7−k. Shares I2C with DRV2605L (0x38 vs 0x5A). INT→IO7 (H1.11). RST = RC
  (internal 3 kΩ pullup to VDDA + 4.7 µF C19 → ~14 ms; no free GPIO left).
  IOVCC/VDD on 3V3 (power-gated). I2C ≤400 kHz.
- **Frontlight (J6 rot 180 at (52.44,20)):** two channels, each 5 white LEDs in
  series, VF ≤ 15 V, IF ≤ 15 mA. 2× SGM3732 (C116578) boost: pins 1 SW, 2 GND,
  3 FB (200 mV), 4 CTRL (PWM 2–60 kHz), 5 VOUT (OVP 38 V), 6 VIN. RSET = 15 Ω
  (C203326) → 13.3 mA. L = 10 µH CY54 (C2929431); D = SS34 (open-LED OVP 38 V
  ⇒ ≥40 V diode + **50 V** output cap CL21B105KBFNNNE C28323; MBR0530 (30 V)
  is NOT safe here). Warm PWM→IO1 (H2.14), cool PWM→IO15 (H1.10).
  Mapping pin k ↔ pad 7−k: W−=pad6, W+=pad5, C−=pad2, C+=pad1.

## Microphone / mid-build additions

Mic: ICS-43434 (below). Flamingo gained: silk lines (display outline + tails
drawn on B.Silk), pad/net label layers, Lock & Route button, right-click pan,
command-aware footprint region parsing (courtyard arc bug). GPIO budget is now
FULL: only strap IO0 remains unassigned.

## Process

1. Slot feature (TDD, subagent) → rebuild, restart server.
2. Verify TP4056 pinout from datasheet (subagent).
3. Build board via MCP tools (parts_get everything first), net classes
   (power: 0.5 mm track; default signal 0.25).
4. Autoroute → run_drc → export_fab (no waiver) → screenshots → commit.

## GNSS antenna (added 2026-07-17, v2 board 66×126.5)

Ignion NN02-224 RUN mXTEND (C5702652) tuned for GNSS per Ignion AN
"GPS/Glonass/Beidou" + UM + DS (all cached in `boards/eink-cell/datasheets/`):

- Bottom antenna strip: copper/via keepout y 0–9.5 both layers (eval board
  clearance is 6.5 × 60; ours is taller because the user wants the antenna
  ≥3 mm off the board edge). GND zones start at y 9.5.
- ANT1 at (7.6, 4.5) rot 180 — body y 3–6, long axis parallel to the edge,
  corner placement per eval board. Pad 1 = feed (per DS footprint fig), at
  (13.217, 4.5); pad 2 is mechanical-only, left floating per DS.
- Feed: 2.0 mm-wide stub (DS "D" dim) north through a keepout gap
  (x 12.0–14.4), necking to 0.6 mm into the matching network.
- Matching (AN Fig 2): series 9.1 nH LQW18AN9N1G80 (L4, C2049208) then
  shunt 3.9 nH LQW15AN3N9B80 (L5, C1329507) to GND; nets ANT / GNSS_RF.
- GNSS_RF terminates at u.FL J7 (HRS U.FL-R-SMT-1(10), C88373) — jumper to
  the Walter module's GNSS u.FL. Note: Ignion recommends final matching
  verification on the assembled device (their free Oxion/support service).
- Bottom M2 holes now at (3.5/62.5, 13.5) — moved up out of the RF strip.

## LTE antenna + bottom strip rework (added 2026-07-19, board now 66 × 128)

Enclosure assumption (user): inner plan envelope = the PCB outline, so the
LTE antenna must live over the board. Chosen part: **Taoglas FXP40.07.0085A**
flex monopole — the smallest cellular flex that covers the Walter/GM02SP low
bands (Cat-M1/NB1/NB2, ~700–960 MHz low band; bands are from Sequans' GM02SP
brief — the Walter datasheet §7.1 only says "connect via u.FL").

- FXP40 mech drawing p.24: body **42.6±0.5 × 12.1±0.4 × 0.24 mm**, 3M 467
  adhesive back, 85±3 mm Ø1.13 coax to **IPEX MHF1** → mates the Walter LTE
  u.FL directly (no carrier RF). Low-band efficiency is modest (12 % @700,
  25 % @900, spec p.4) — fine for LTE-M link budgets. Order separately
  (DigiKey; not on the JLC BOM — no pads, adhesive mount).
- **Board grew 126.5 → 128 mm**: bottom edge extended to y=−1.5 (outline is
  now a raw path; content above y 9.5 untouched, GNSS chain untouched at
  absolute coords). Bottom M2 holes ride the new corner arcs at (3/63, 1.5).
  Shrinking was not possible: no real ~700 MHz flex is under ~12 mm tall.
- **Adhesive area** (F.Silk outline + "LTE ANT" label): x 17.5–60.5,
  y −0.75–11.75 (43 × 12.5 = worst-case part + placement margin; 0.75 mm to
  the board edge and to the display-tail slot at y 12.5). Right edge clears
  the (63, 1.5) mounting-hole pad; left edge is ~5 mm from the W3011 —
  GM02SP time-shares LTE and GNSS, so coupling is acceptable.
- **Strip keepout retiled** (9 tiles, F+B copper+via): full coverage from the
  new edge to y 9.5 plus an x 17–61 bridge band y 9.5–12.1 meeting the slot
  keepout, leaving only the W3011 pad notch (x 8.15–12.8, y 4.3–6.7) and feed
  corridor (x 9.88–11.85, y 6.7–9.5) open. This also removed two pre-existing
  defects in the 38909bc gerbers: a floating 2.15 × 3.14 mm pour island (both
  layers) in the old ANT position pocket at x 20.65–22.8, and a 0.4 × 0.5 mm
  F.Cu sliver above pad 1.
- **Two B.Cu-only keepouts added** (pad notch + corridor): the notch/corridor
  openings are pad/track passages on F.Cu only; without these the back pour
  flowed down the corridor and filled the notch — copper under the W3011,
  against its DS p.6 "all layers" clearance rule. This was already present in
  the 38909bc fab export; now clean (verified in gerbers).
- Serial silk moved to B.Silk (38, 4) — the front strip is under the flex.
- Filled DRC 0; export_fab passes with no waiver; fab/ + Super_Pager-fab.zip
  + Super_Pager.step regenerated. The older eink-cell*.step exports predate
  the outline change (stale).

## Battery (added 2026-07-19)

**EEMB LP603048LC 900 mAh protected 1S LiPo** (datasheet
`EEMB_LP603048LC_900mAh.pdf`): 6.3 × 30.5 × 49 mm max (≈50 incl. PCM/tabs,
p4), charge max **1C = 900 mA** (p3 §2.7 — the only cell in this footprint
class rated above 0.5C), discharge 2C = 1.8 A (p3 §2.8), rated to −40 °C
(p3 §2.9). Capacity alternate if the stack can take 10 mm:
DNK/YDL **LP103048 1500 mAh** (`DNK103048_1500mAh_PCM.pdf` — 0.5C = 750 mA
charge, 3C/10 ms pulse). Both ship with JST-PH 2.0 leads → re-terminate to
JST-SH 1.0 for J2; **JST lead polarity is not standardized — board expects
+ on J2 pin 1, meter before first plug-in.** Protected cell is mandatory
(no separate protection IC on the board).

- **Placement**: on the component side ("front"), flat bare zone right of the
  Walter module — F.Silk corner brackets at **x 31.2–61.2, y 55.5–105.5**
  (30 × 50 bay; cell rides over the ≤1.1 mm parts at the edges: Q1/C15/R1/R2
  south, R7/R8/C17/C6 north; foam tape). Bounded by the Walter overhang
  (x 30.4) and side switches (x ~62); J2 plug 2 mm below the bay, J3/U2
  clear above. Back-side testpoints TP6–9/TP14 under the bay stay probeable.
- **Charge current retuned for the cell**: R1 PROG 1.2 k → **1.5 k (C22843,
  Basic)** → 733 mA typ / 843 mA max (TP4056 DS p5: Ibat ≈ 1100/R; ±15 %
  tolerance would have put the old 917 mA typ over the cell's 900 mA rating).
  843 mA worst-case also sits at the 103048 alternate's 750 mA limit
  (+12 %, softened by the TP4056 thermal fold-back), so both cells work
  without another swap. Same R0603 pads — routing untouched.
